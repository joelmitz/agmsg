# No external `timeout` dependency: coreutils' timeout is commonly absent on
# macOS, and running handle without any bound at all on that path silently
# dropped tool.conf's timeout= entirely -- a hung handle then leaked a
# process forever and the sender never heard back, either (review finding).
#
# `set -m` gives the backgrounded job its OWN process group (pgid == the
# leader's own pid), instead of inheriting this script's, so a TERM/KILL
# addressed to the group (`kill -- -PGID`, the leading '-' means "the group",
# not "the single process") reaches handle's own grandchildren too -- a
# handle that is itself a wrapper backgrounding further work used to leave
# that work orphaned when only its own pid was signaled. `set +m` right
# after is just this script returning to its own default mode.
#
# This does NOT poll $HPID with kill -0 (an earlier version of this script
# did, and that was wrong): bash can reap a background child via its SIGCHLD
# handler before this script ever calls `wait`, at which point the kernel is
# free to hand the same pid to an unrelated process -- a poll loop watching
# $HPID across multiple `sleep`s can end up signaling that unrelated process
# instead. Two independent things happen concurrently instead: a "killer"
# subshell that, once TIMEOUT elapses, sends TERM then KILL to the group
# UNLESS handle already finished (see DONE_FILE below), and this script's own
# `wait "$HPID"`, which bash tracks correctly for its own direct child
# regardless of reap timing. The killer is started AFTER $HPID is assigned --
# it is a subshell forked from this script's own state, so it must see the
# real value, not an empty one from before handle was launched.
#
# The killer is deliberately never stopped by pid. An earlier version of
# this script called `kill "$KILLER_PID"` once wait returned, to cancel the
# killer if it hadn't fired yet -- but on the timeout path the killer
# finishes (TERM, then KILL, then exit) and gets reaped well before this
# script gets back around to that `kill`, so that `kill "$KILLER_PID"` could
# land on an unrelated process that reused the same pid (the same class of
# bug this whole rewrite exists to close, just moved one level up). Instead:
# this script creates DONE_FILE the moment wait returns, and the killer
# checks for DONE_FILE BEFORE doing anything, not after -- if handle already
# finished, the killer sees DONE_FILE and does nothing at all.
#
# This script itself then `wait`s for the killer (see below, after the
# reply is already sent) rather than exiting right away. It is never a
# standing process even so: it always exits once the killer does, which is
# at most TIMEOUT seconds away, not indefinitely. Exiting immediately after
# the reply, instead, let the EXIT trap delete DONE_FILE while the killer
# was still asleep -- on every ordinary fast-finishing call, not just the
# narrow boundary case below, the killer would then wake up, find no
# DONE_FILE, and wrongly signal a group that had already finished (review
# finding: this actually happened, on every fast call, not a theoretical
# race).
