// Internal team names must not appear in what we publish. This repository IS

// directories or extensions. A list would be short by one the next time someone
// adds a file type.
//
// Two detectors, because the two kinds of name need different treatment:
//
//   SHAPE      seat names follow <base>-cc<n> / <base>-co<n>. A pattern catches
//              the whole class, including seats that do not exist yet, and puts
//              no name into this file. Always runs.
//
//   INJECTED   names with no shape — a person's handle, a project nickname —
//              cannot be patterned. They are supplied from outside the repo,
//              because writing them here would publish exactly what the rule
//              exists to keep unpublished. A checker that leaks its own subject
//              is not a checker.
//
// Absent injection is a FAILURE, never a pass. A check that quietly does
// nothing is worse than no check: its green is read as "clean".

/**
 * Word boundaries by explicit character class, never `\b`. Two measured
 * reasons, one of them load-bearing today:
 *
 * 1. `-` must NOT be a boundary here. These two are the SHAPE's boundaries, and
 *    a shape is built out of hyphens: with `\b`, `<a>-<b>-cc<n>` could match from
 *    the middle and report `<b>-cc<n>`, naming a seat that does not exist while
 *    the real one goes unreported. Excluding `-` forces the match to start at
 *    the beginning of the name. (The bare-name boundaries are separate, and
 *    deliberately looser — see below.)
 *
 * 2. It says what it means. `\b` is defined against `\w`, so reading a pattern
 *    requires knowing which characters that covers in this engine — and the
 *    answer differs between engines on the same text. Python's `re` treats `の`
 *    as a word character, so a handle written straight against a particle in
 *    the Japanese docs matches nothing; JavaScript's `\w` is ASCII and finds
 *    it. Both were measured. The class below cannot drift that way, and those
 *    docs are real input here.

 * Bare names get plain boundaries on both sides, and DO overlap the shape.
 *
 * Two earlier versions tried to keep a seat name from being reported twice --
 * once by the shape, once as the bare name inside it -- and each attempt left a
 * hole where neither detector fired:
 *
 *   refusing `-` on the LEFT   missed `<team>-<name>`, 17 real occurrences
 *   refusing `-` on the RIGHT  missed `<name>-approved`, found in review
 *   suppressing when a role follows missed `<hyphenated-base>-cc<n>` entirely,
 *     because the shape does not match it either
 *
 * Every hole came from the same wish. A duplicate report costs a reader one
 * confused moment; a hole costs a published name. So the suppression is gone:
 * a seat name built on a listed base is reported by both detectors, and the
 * summary counts lines as well as findings so "two findings" reads as the one

/**
 * A listed name used as a shell IDENTIFIER is code, not attribution, and is not
 * reported. Measured on the tree (2026-09-06): one two-letter handle is also
 * the name storage drivers give to a local variable, in 102 lines of `$name` /
 * `${name}` / `name=` and 19 declaration lines (`local … name …`,
 * `read -r … name …`), plus one arithmetic use `$(( name + … ))`. Listing the
 * handle without these guards reports 262 lines for 106 real ones, which is how
 * a check gets switched off.
 *
 * Each guard names ONE syntactic context and nothing wider:
 *   $name, ${name}      a variable reference
 *   name=               an assignment (prose puts a space before `=`)
 *   (( … name … ))      shell arithmetic, until the closing paren
 *   local … name …      a declaration line: the first word (after any
 *                       `VAR=value` prefixes) is a declaring builtin, and the
 *                       name sits before any `#`. A comment on the same line is

 *                       embedded PNG). The guard ends at the closing quote or
 *                       whitespace, so text after the URI is scanned again.
 * Nothing here refuses punctuation prose actually uses — `name.`, `name,`,
 * `(name)`, `name's`, `name/other` all still report — so the guards cannot
 * hide a sentence. They are tested one by one in tests/private_names.test.mjs.
