# Slack ext-tool setup

Read this when `join <team> <name> ext-tool --tool slack` stops because no
member config exists yet. This is a guide for YOU (the seat LLM) to follow
while talking to the user — `setup` itself does not talk to anyone; you run
it, read its JSON, and decide what to say next.

**Do not hardcode any path in this file, including `~/.agents/skills/agmsg`.**
An install named anything other than `agmsg` (e.g. `agmsg-ext`) puts
everything under that other name instead. You are reading this exact file
from a real path already — it is `<skill-root>/scripts/drivers/ext-tools/slack/SETUP.md`
— so derive `<skill-root>` from wherever you actually found it. `ext-tool.sh`
below (also under `<skill-root>/scripts/`) resolves and passes the member
config path itself for every command that needs one; you never compute or
type that path.

Never ask the user to paste their bot token into the chat, and never run
`ext-tool.sh setup ... save` with a token value you were given directly.
The token goes in through `ext-tool.sh secret` (there is no `agmsg ext-tool
secret` command), which reads it without echoing and writes it to a file
only you get the *path* to — you only ever handle that path.

## The five steps

1. **Create the Slack app from the manifest.**
   Tell the user to go to <https://api.slack.com/apps>, choose "Create New
   App" → "From an app manifest", pick their workspace, and paste the
   contents of `manifest.json` (next to this file). Confirm the app was
   created.

2. **Install it to the workspace.**
   In the app's "Install App" page, have them click "Install to Workspace"
   and approve the scopes. Slack then shows a **Bot User OAuth Token**
   starting with `xoxb-`.

3. **Save the bot token as a secret.**
   Ask the user to copy the `xoxb-…` token to their system clipboard (from
   Slack's Install App page), then run this YOURSELF:
   ```
   bash <skill-root>/scripts/ext-tool.sh secret <team> <name> --from-clipboard
   ```
   This reads `pbpaste`/`wl-paste`/`xclip`/`xsel`/PowerShell's
   `Get-Clipboard` (whichever exists) and saves the value straight to a
   0600 file, answering only "Saved to `<path>`. (The value itself is not
   shown or logged.)" — you never see the token, only that path. Take
   `<path>` from that line and use it as `<key_file>` below. If there is
   no clipboard access (a headless environment, or the read fails), fall
   back to asking the user to run it in a real terminal themselves
   instead, without `--from-clipboard`:
   ```
   bash <skill-root>/scripts/ext-tool.sh secret <team> <name>
   ```
   which prompts and reads the token without echoing it — this form needs
   a real TTY, which is why it cannot run through you inside Claude Code's
   own `!` passthrough. It reports the same "Saved to `<path>`." line; ask
   the user to read it back to you since you did not run this form
   yourself. **Never accept a pasted token value in chat.**

4. **Verify the token, then pick and verify a channel.**
   ```
   bash <skill-root>/scripts/ext-tool.sh setup <team> <name> slack check token <key_file>
   ```
   - `{"ok":true,...}` → token works, continue.
   - `{"ok":false,"error":"invalid_auth"}` → the token is wrong or was
     revoked. Have them re-check step 2/3 and re-save.
   - `{"ok":false,"error":"missing_scope"}` → the app's scopes don't match
     `manifest.json` (an app created by hand, or an older manifest). Have
     them add `chat:write` and `channels:read` under OAuth & Permissions,
     reinstall the app, and get a fresh token.

   Ask the user which channel to post to, **by channel ID, not name** —
   `check channel` calls Slack's `conversations.info`, which only accepts an
   ID (`C…`), never a `#name`. If the user gives a name, tell them how to get
   the ID: in Slack, click the channel name at the top of the channel → the
   panel that opens shows the Channel ID at the very bottom (or: right-click
   the channel in the sidebar → "View channel details" → same place). Then:
   ```
   bash <skill-root>/scripts/ext-tool.sh setup <team> <name> slack check channel <key_file> <channel_id>
   ```
   - `{"ok":true,"exists":true,"bot_member":true}` → ready.
   - `{"ok":true,"exists":true,"bot_member":false}` → channel is real but the
     bot isn't in it. Tell the user to run `/invite @<the app's name>` in
     that channel (the name they gave the app in step 1), then check again.
   - `{"ok":false,"error":"channel_not_found"}` → the ID is wrong, or it's a
     private channel and the bot lacks `groups:read` (public channels only
     need `channels:read`) — add `groups:read` and reinstall if the target
     is private.

5. **Save, then send a real test message.**
   ```
   bash <skill-root>/scripts/ext-tool.sh setup <team> <name> slack save <key_file> <channel_id>
   bash <skill-root>/scripts/ext-tool.sh setup <team> <name> slack test
   ```
   `ext-tool.sh` resolves and passes the member config path itself for both
   of these — you only ever supply `<key_file>` and `<channel_id>`. `test`
   posts one real message ("agmsg: Slack setup test message.") and reports
   `{"ok":true}`, `{"ok":true,"permalink":"https://..."}`, or
   `{"ok":false,"error":"..."}`.
   When a `permalink` comes back, share that link with the user directly
   rather than asking "did it show up?" — it is only there for `setup test`;
   an ordinary send through `handle` stays silent on purpose (a reply would
   wake the sending seat again). No `permalink` field just means the link
   itself could not be fetched (e.g. a missing scope) even though the
   message did send — `"ok":true` on its own still means it worked, so ask
   the user to look for it in that case instead of treating this as a
   failure.

## Common failures, and what actually fixes them

| error | what it means | fix |
|---|---|---|
| `invalid_auth` | token is wrong, revoked, or from the wrong workspace | re-copy the token from step 2, re-save via `secret` |
| `not_in_channel` | bot has a valid token but isn't a member of the channel | `/invite @<bot>` in that channel |
| `channel_not_found` | channel ID is wrong, or it's private and the bot lacks `groups:read` | confirm the ID; add `groups:read` + reinstall for a private channel |
| `missing_scope` | the installed app doesn't have `chat:write` (or `channels:read` for `check channel`) | add the scope in OAuth & Permissions, reinstall, get a new token |
| `account_inactive` / `token_revoked` | the token was revoked (app uninstalled, token rotated) | reinstall the app, save the new token |
| rate limited (HTTP 429) | too many requests too fast | wait a few seconds and retry; not a configuration problem |
| a one-line message naming `curl`, a host, or a timeout | `handle`/`setup` couldn't reach the API at all (DNS, network, TLS) | check the machine's network; if `AGMSG_SLACK_API_BASE` is set in the real environment (it should only be set by the test suite), unset it — a value left over from testing silently redirects real messages nowhere |
