# claude-desktop terminal driver — a Claude Code session running in the
# Claude desktop app's Code tab.
#
# Sourced by the terminals registry into the caller's context. terminal_* only,
# no set -e/-u.
#
# Why this driver exists: the desktop app's Code tab has no pane at all — its
# only handle is the conversation itself (the Claude Code session id). Without
# a driver for it, a desktop seat either resolved to plain's "no addressable
# pane" sentinel or inherited whatever pane env var happened to be lying
# around (observed 2026-10-02: a desktop seat carrying a stale herdr
# placement left behind by an earlier terminal session). This driver gives it
# its own identity instead: present and addressable by session id, but with
# no pane to peek, poke, spawn, despawn, arrange or name.
#
# MEASURED 2026-10-02, on a live, desktop-spawned Claude Code process: its
# environment carries CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=claude-desktop (a plain terminal
# session carries CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=cli), and CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID —
# the variable a terminal session's own identity is normally read from — is
# ABSENT. The value that IS present and carries this process's own identity
# is CLAUDE_CODE_HOST_SESSION_ID instead (observed value shape:
# local_<uuid>). Both variables are tried below, in that order.
#
# Step 1 scope (see memory/design/2026-10-02-desktop-app-terminal-drivers.md):
# detect + where only. Waking an idle desktop session, delivery changes, and
# everything else are explicitly out of scope for this driver.

# ABI hook: is <id> usable as a placement id? The desktop app's session id is
# an opaque token this driver has not measured a strict grammar for (unlike
# orca's UUID-shaped handle) — Claude Code's own session id is what is
# addressed, not something this driver mints or parses. What this driver DOES
# own is framing safety: a tab, newline or carriage return in the id would
# corrupt a tab-separated placement record (same concern orca's own
# _orca_handle_ok header documents), so that is the one thing checked here.

# stdout: the caller's argument if non-empty (the same value every other
# driver here is handed), else the environment.
#
# MEASURED 2026-10-02 against a live desktop-spawned Claude Code process:
# the ordinary CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID a terminal session carries is ABSENT
# there; the environment variable that is actually present and holds this
# process's own identity is CLAUDE_CODE_HOST_SESSION_ID instead. Both are
# tried, CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID first (in case a future or differently
# configured host sets it) — nothing else is consulted, so a
# present-but-unresolved desktop session prints nothing and names the
# reason on stderr rather than guessing.
