# orca terminal driver — a terminal hosted by the Orca multi-agent IDE
# (github.com/stablyai/orca), addressed by its own opaque `term_<uuid>` handle.
#
# Sourced by the terminals registry into the caller's context. terminal_* only,
# no set -e/-u.
#
# PR3 SCOPE (builds on PR1's read-only set): spawn/despawn/name are now real.
# arrange remains unimplemented and reports unsupported (13), the same
# convention `plain` uses for a capability its manifest does not advertise —
# orca's own CLI has no reordering verb at all (checked against 1.4.206).
#
# PR4 SCOPE: adds terminal_enumerate_panes, one of the two OPTIONAL
# sweep/self-proof ops — read-only, nothing written. terminal_pane_process_
# observe, the other one, is DELIBERATELY NOT DEFINED: confirmed live, one
# throwaway pane, before writing anything (the two other, real, pre-existing
# terminals untouched throughout), that `orca terminal show`'s JSON has no
# field carrying an OS process id anywhere (handle/ptyId/incarnationId/
# tabId/leafId/connected/writable/preview/paneRuntimeId/rendererGraphEpoch —
# checked `--help` too, no flag surfaces one either). See the comment where
# that op would otherwise live, further down, for why "define it and always
# fail" is the wrong answer to a permanent gap, not just a smaller one.
#
# PR2 SCOPE: terminal_poke is now real, and adds the optional
# terminal_input_draft hook (composer-draft read, gated on show's
# agentIdentity field).
#
# MEASURED (directly against real orca instances, orca 1.4.198 and 1.4.206;
# not asserted):
#   - `ORCA_TERMINAL_HANDLE` is set, inside an Orca-hosted pane, to the exact
#     handle every `orca terminal <verb> --terminal <handle>` call addresses
#     that pane by — no PID/TTY witness-matching needed, unlike `plain`.
#     `TERM_PROGRAM=Orca` is set alongside it in every pane checked.
#   - `orca terminal show --terminal <handle> --json` on a handle that once
#     existed and was closed answers ok:true, with connected:false,
#     writable:false, orphaned:true and an exitCause object — a real, gone
#     pane, positively confirmed. On a handle orca has never heard of (a typo,
#     or one from a fully-reset instance) it answers ok:false instead, error
#     code terminal_handle_stale — that shape is NOT proof of gone, only proof
#     of "could not resolve"; the two must not be conflated, so pane_state
#     below keeps them apart.
#   - `orca terminal close` on an already-closed handle changed behaviour
#     between versions measured 3 days apart on the same machine: 1.4.198
#     returned an error (terminal_handle_stale); 1.4.206 returns ok:true,
#     ptyKilled:false. `close`'s own return is therefore NOT a stable signal
#     for "already gone" across versions — this is exactly why pane_state is
#     built on `show` alone, never on `close`.
#   - `orca terminal read --terminal <handle> --screen --json` returns the
#     rendered frame as a plain-text `tail` array — no ANSI/color/SGR
#     information in any read mode; nothing to lose by always using --screen.

# OPTIONAL op: report <id>'s composer draft, but only when `show` says an
# agent integration is actually present. MEASURED (throwaway terminal, this
# PR, Claude Code v2.1.281 on orca, via `read --screen`): the JSON carries a
# `draft` field at `$.result.terminal.draft`, sibling to `tail`, holding the
# box's real typed text — present once real characters have been typed,
# ABSENT both when the box is truly empty and when it only shows a dim
# candidate suggestion (e.g. `Try "fix typecheck errors"`). That absence is
# exactly the ambiguity this op exists to resolve: on a pane with no agent CLI
# running at all, `draft` is equally absent, and reporting that as "empty
# draft" would be a false claim of a real, checked fact. `show`'s own
# `agentIdentity` field (`$.result.terminal.agentIdentity`, e.g. "claude") is
# present iff orca has recognized an agent integration for this pane,
# independent of `draft` — so it is the gate: identity absent means "cannot
# tell", identity present means an absent `draft` really is a decided,
# checked "nothing typed". Always reads via `--screen`, matching terminal_peek
# (measured: `draft` was observed alongside --screen's own `tail`; there is no
# separate measurement of the non-screen mode carrying it, so this driver only
# claims the mode it actually checked).
#
#   0    identity present; stdout is base64(draft), empty stdout when the key
#        itself is absent (a real "nothing to preserve", not an unknown).
#        Base64, not raw text (review, #1443): exact text — including a
#        trailing newline, or Shift+Enter multi-line content — cannot survive
#        raw stdout + command substitution, which strips every trailing
#        newline unconditionally; "x" and "x\n" would otherwise be
#        indistinguishable to any caller capturing this op's output. Embedded
#        newlines from base64's own optional line-wrapping (GNU wraps at 76
#        cols by default, BSD/macOS does not) are stripped in pure bash after
#        capture, so the encoded form is always exactly one line regardless of
#        implementation.
#   10   could not be determined at all: orca unreachable (not on PATH, or
#        answered ok:false with error.code=runtime_unavailable), the show
#        call's JSON did not parse or answered ok:false for any other reason,
#        OR the call succeeded but no agentIdentity is reported for this pane
#   12   identity WAS confirmed present, but any of: the subsequent draft read
#        itself failed (unparsable JSON, ok:false, no output); `draft` was
#        present but its JSON type was something other than a string (null,
#        object, array, number, boolean — review, #1443: folding every
#        non-text shape to "" via _orca_json_field would report a broken
#        response as a confirmed, decided empty box, rather than the
#        malformed answer it actually is); the extraction's own sqlite3 call
#        exited non-zero (review, #1443 round 2: `"$(cmd; printf x)"` always
#        exits 0 regardless of `cmd`'s own status, so a real extraction
#        failure would otherwise silently become a confirmed-empty 0 — `&&`
#        instead of `;` before the sentinel is what makes this failure visible
#        at all); or base64-encoding itself failed. All distinct from 10 on
#        purpose: none of these is "no identity", so none is folded into its
#        unknown sentinel.
#
# stdout carries an `unknown:<reason>` sentinel on every 10 path (the

#
# AN ENTRY WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND FAILS THE WHOLE ENUMERATION (same discipline
# as terminal_peek's own tail-array validation above and tmux/herdr's own
# copies of this op): `$.result.terminals` must be a JSON array, and every
# element's `$.handle` must be JSON text; the count of elements is compared
# against the count of ones with a valid handle, and any mismatch means this
# driver does not understand the payload well enough to say what is really
# out there, rather than silently reporting fewer panes than exist.
#
# "JSON text" alone is not "a real orca id" (review, #1441): a handle of ""
# or one carrying a control byte, or one that is text but not this driver's
# own term_<uuid> grammar (a foreign or corrupted value), all passed the
# json_type check but were then either silently DROPPED at print time (an
# undercount masquerading as a complete list — exactly the failure this
# whole discipline exists to prevent) or printed through unvalidated as a
# pane id the rest of this driver would refuse if asked about it directly.
# Every extracted handle is now run through terminal_id_ok -- the SAME
# authority terminal_detect and every other op in this file already answer
# to -- and one failure anywhere aborts the whole enumeration rather than
# quietly narrowing it. Duplicate handles get the same treatment: a payload
# is not "a set of distinct live panes" once a handle repeats, so the whole
# read is nothing this op understands well enough to report, rather than a
# false confirmation that one pane is reachable through two different rows.

# terminal_pane_process_observe is DELIBERATELY NOT DEFINED (review, #1441).
# MEASURED, not assumed (one throwaway pane, before this PR wrote anything):
# `orca terminal show`'s JSON has no field anywhere that carries an OS
# process id, and no `--help` flag surfaces one either — this op could never
# actually succeed for orca, on any candidate, ever. self-proof.sh's own
# contract treats the two shapes of "no answer" differently and on purpose:
# the function being UNDEFINED reports unsupported/driver_no_process_binding
# (rc 3) and the caller stops asking; the function being defined but
# returning a non-{0,13} code every time reports undetermined/
# pane_process_unreadable (rc 2) instead — a TEMPORARY failure a caller
# retries. Orca's gap is permanent, not temporary, so defining this op just
# to always fail would misreport which kind of "no" self-proof is getting.
# `plain`'s own driver already omits this exact op for the same reason (its
# own file has no process-binding primitive at all) — this is that same
# precedent, not a new one. Self-proof for orca seats does not need this op
# regardless: they identify themselves directly through $ORCA_TERMINAL_HANDLE
# (see the file header), which never needed a process/pid binding.

# `arrange` is unimplemented — reported as `unsupported`, the same word
# `plain` uses for a capability its manifest does not advertise (13). It is
# not in this driver's terminal.conf `capabilities=` line, so a caller
# checking the manifest first should never reach it at all; it exists because
# the terminal ABI requires every driver to define every required function
# (the loader verifies it — see scripts/lib/terminal-registry.sh's
# _AGMSG_TERMINAL_REQUIRED). Orca's own `--help` has no reordering/move/swap
# verb for a terminal or its tab (checked against 1.4.206's CLI surface) —
# nothing for this driver to call, not a choice not to wire one up.

# step here and therefore none of their lost-keystroke race: `orca terminal
# create --command` launches the boot text AS the pane's own initial process
# (measured, Third pass (c)) — the command is argv, not typed input, so there
# is nothing to type before the shell is ready because there is no separate
# typing step at all.
#
# <target> (window|pane-h|pane-v) is validated the same as tmux/herdr — a typo
# must fail, not silently spawn — but orca's `create` has no window/split
# distinction of its own (every call just adds one more terminal to the
# worktree), so all three valid values behave identically here.

# value almost immediately regardless of how it was set, so the caller's own
# later `terminal_name` call (against the TAB title via `rename`, which does
# hold) is what actually names this pane.
