# control op: name the pane. The RESOLVABLE key is a pane user option
# @agmsg_agent = <team>:<agent> (scope Naming: tmux is never targeted by name —
# '-t a:b' is session:window to tmux — so peek/poke scan @agmsg_agent instead).
# select-pane -T sets the human-visible title as a copy. Canonical separator is
# ':' (both team and agent commonly contain '-'). Idempotent (safe to re-apply on
# SessionStart).
# <mode> is `key` or absent — see the herdr driver for the split. Here the
# `@agmsg_agent` pane option is the resolvable one and the window name / pane
# title is the decoration, so `key` sets the option and stops.
