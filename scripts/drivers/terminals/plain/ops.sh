# no set -e/-u. Per the v1 scope, plain IMPLEMENTS spawn/despawn (the existing

# for peek/poke/name — it has no addressable pane, so an op that cannot run says
# so, it does not exit 0 quietly.
#
# The launch template comes from AGMSG_TERMINAL (its EXISTING meaning — an
# OS-terminal command template, distinct from the resolver's driver override
# AGMSG_TERMINAL_DRIVER) or, if the caller passes it, config spawn.terminal.

# question is answered. Deliberately said WITHOUT asking who the caller is:
# "which terminal am I in" is this driver's question, "does this agent have
# native messaging" is the type's — mixing them here would rebuild the
# presence-vs-binary confusion this axis just removed.
#
# peek stays a plain dead end ON PURPOSE — the asymmetry is measured, not an
# oversight: a native WRITE path exists (SendMessage), but there is no native
# READ path in today's CLI (`claude logs <id>` serves background jobs only —
# interactive ids answer "No job matching" — and `claude agents --json` lists
# status, never screen content). If a read endpoint ever appears, this is the
