# Usage:
#   ext-tool.sh setup <team> <name> <tool> status
#   ext-tool.sh setup <team> <name> <tool> check <item> [args...]
#   ext-tool.sh setup <team> <name> <tool> save [args...]
#   ext-tool.sh setup <team> <name> <tool> test
#   ext-tool.sh secret <team> <name>
#   ext-tool.sh secret <team> <name> --from-clipboard
#   ext-tool.sh usage <team> <name>
#   ext-tool.sh usage <tool>
#
# `usage` prints a tool's USAGE.md (how to ask it for things, once it's
# joined) -- the <team> <name> form resolves the tool from that member's own
# saved config; the single-<tool> form reads it directly, for looking it up
# before ever joining. A tool with no USAGE.md yet says so in one line
# rather than making one up.
#
# Common entry point for configuring an ext-tool member
# (scripts/drivers/ext-tools/README.md has the full contract). `setup`
# forwards status/check/save/test to the named tool's own non-interactive
# `setup` executable, resolving <team>/<name>'s config path first. `save`
# gets config_path plus whatever [args...] the caller gave, forwarded
# verbatim, in order -- a tool's own save may need more than config_path
# (e.g. a key file path, a channel id) and this entry point does not know or
# care what those are. `check <item>` gets [args...] the same way but WITHOUT
# config_path -- it verifies a raw, not-yet-saved value, so a tool's own
# check never expects one. The conversation with the user happens at the
# calling seat, which reads the tool's SETUP.md and calls these one at a
# time; nothing here holds a conversation of its own. `secret` reads one
# value without echoing it,
# writes it to a 0600 file, and reports only that it was saved — never the
# value. Its plain form reads from THIS terminal only (refused when not run
# on one, same as `key.sh show --reveal-secret`); `--from-clipboard` reads
# the system clipboard instead, so a user calling through an agent's `!`
# (which has no real TTY of its own) can still do this without opening a
# separate terminal -- `! bash .../ext-tool.sh secret <team> <name>
# --from-clipboard` after copying the value. The clipboard is left alone
# after reading (it is the user's, not this script's, to clear).
