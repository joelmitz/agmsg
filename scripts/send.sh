#   send.sh <team> <from> <to> <message> [--force] [--print-id] # body as ONE quoted arg
#   send.sh <team> <from> <to> --body-file <path> [--force]     # body read from a file
#   send.sh <team> <from> <to> --body - [--force]               # body read from stdin
#
# --body-file matches poke.sh, for the same reason (#507) AND to close #1101: a caller
# who learned --body-file from poke used to have send take the literal string
# "--body-file" as the message and exit zero (the flag has different meanings on the two
# adjacent commands). A positional <message> also passes through the CALLER's shell first,
# where a backtick or $( ) executes and its span silently vanishes; send bodies are longer
# and likelier to contain them. So a message that is a bare unconsumed flag (starts with
# --, and is not --body-file/--body) is now REFUSED rather than sent, and a mistyped flag
# never lands as content. Trailing newlines are stripped from a file/stdin body, as in
# poke (command-substitution semantics).
