# peek.sh — look at a named member's terminal screen without switching panes.
#
# Usage:
#   peek.sh <team> <name> [--lines N]
#
#   <team>     team the member is in
#   <name>     the member whose pane to read
#   --lines N  include scrollback: the driver decides what N means for its
#              backend (tmux: last N lines; herdr: the 'recent' source)
#
# Read-only. The member's placement record (run/spawn.<team>__<name>, written
# at placement time) names the terminal and the pane id; that terminal's driver
# is loaded and terminal_peek prints the pane text verbatim. The terminal comes
# from the RECORD, never from this caller's environment — an exported
# AGMSG_TERMINAL_DRIVER must not make us read a herdr pane id as a tmux one
# (v1 scope ruling: the override applies to resolution, never to something
# already placed).
#
# A terminal without an addressable pane (plain) refuses with
# "unsupported: <why>" on stderr and a non-zero exit — never a silent 0.
