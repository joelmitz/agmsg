# despawn.sh — tear down a spawned crew member, the inverse of spawn.sh.
#
# Usage:
#   despawn.sh <team> <from> <name> [--force] [--timeout <secs>]
#
#   <team>   team the member is in
#   <from>   the leader's own agent name (sender of the control message)
#   <name>   the member to tear down
#
# Default (graceful): send a `ctrl:despawn` control message to <name>. The
# member's watcher (watch.sh) sees it, drops its own role (releasing the actas
# lock) and folds its OWN pane through the terminal driver named by its placement
# record — so tmux AND herdr members fold themselves (a plain/OS-terminal member
# has no addressable pane, so it drops its role and its window is closed by hand).
# We block until the lock is released, up to --timeout; on timeout the member
# didn't respond (dead watcher, or a monitor=no member with no watcher) — re-run
# with --force. A `free` lock with a placement record is NOT proof the member is
# gone (a monitor=no type never holds one): that reports `needs-force` and KEEPS
# the record, rather than a false `ok` (#625).
#
# --force: skip the message and tear the member down from here through the
# terminal driver named by the placement record. The teardown must be CONFIRMED
# (the ref resolves to a terminal, the driver loads, and terminal_despawn exits 0)
# BEFORE the record / registration / lock are dropped — an unconfirmed teardown
# keeps all three and reports `status=error`, so the record (the only retry
# authority) is never deleted out from under a pane that is still alive (#625, the
# --force side). For when the member's watcher can't respond.
#
# See #109.
