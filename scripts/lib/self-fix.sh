# self-fix.sh -- `fix`: a seat establishes where it is, and repairs itself there.
#
# NO ARGUMENTS. This is the whole design (#1152, ruling of 2026-09-13). A location
# handed in from outside is the accident this exists to remove: measured live,
# a seat whose label had been broken resolved itself through an inherited
# environment into ANOTHER seat's pane and wrote that pane into its own mark --
# it stopped short of typing there only because that pane's name was not
# readable. So nothing tells the seat where it is. The seat proves it:
#
#   1. identity  -- which seats this session holds, from the actas locks it OWNS
#                   (identity is not location; a lock names a role, not a pane)
#   2. candidate -- the pane the environment names, as a CANDIDATE only; the
#                   environment is a generator, never an authority
#   3. proof     -- agmsg_self_proof (#1154): the pane's process is in the
#                   owner's complete ancestry, or it is not, or we cannot tell
#   4. fallback  -- when the proof does not say proved and #1188's emit-and-
#                   observe is present (agmsg_token_locate_pending / _emit /
#                   _observe, #1386), that runs, in the same four-state
#                   contract -- across two SEPARATE calls to this whole
#                   script, since a token this call both emits and searches
#                   for in the same breath is never actually on screen yet
#                   to find (see token-locate.sh)
#   5. write     -- ONLY on proved: the record and decorations through
#                   agmsg_self_write, under the seat-local lock. Anything else
#                   is reported by name and NOTHING is written.
#
# Whoever runs it -- a poke from another seat, a person at the keyboard, a skill
# on a loop -- gets the same answer, because none of them carries a location.
#
# OUTPUT. One line per seat this session holds, then the writer's lines:
#   fix seat=<team>/<agent> state=proved locator=<kind:instance:pane> via=<proof|emit_observe>
#   fix seat=<team>/<agent> state=<disproved|undetermined|unsupported> reason=<r> via=<...> (written nothing)
#   fix none:<no_seat_for_this_session|arguments_refused|...>
# Exit: 0 when every held seat was written; 2 when at least one was not; 1 on refusal.

# THE DIRECTION IS INVERTED (#1457 review round 4). Three rounds running,
# guessing "is this lock's FILENAME an id or a name" from the filename
# alone kept finding one more edge case to close -- a legacy name shaped
# like two UUIDv7s, a round trip that also happens to match a real,
# separately registered legacy pair, and so on. Walking every REGISTERED
# seat instead and asking where ITS OWN lock would be makes the question
# moot: actas_lock_path already knows, for a given (team, agent) NAME
# pair, whether that seat's lock is id-keyed or legacy -- the same
# id-or-legacy resolution every other reader of a role already uses, not
# a guess made from a filename. Nothing here ever parses a filename back
# into a name; the names are already in hand from config.json, and the
# path built from them is what gets checked against disk. A team's seat
# count is small (tens at most), so walking every one costs nothing

# Whether (team, agent)'s codex thread state matches CODEX_THREAD_ID, by

# no-op, not a failure), and session-start.sh exits 0 on every early return
# (no app-server yet, no seat key, an already-live bridge) -- none of those

#
# Checks the role-session record first, then the bridge's own recorded
# thread -- at BOTH candidate bridge_keys (#1470 review round 6), because
# the two writer architectures do not agree on which one a role actually
# uses. The out-of-sandbox launcher's dispatcher spawns one CHILD PER ROLE
# PAIR, so its bridge_key is always the single-pair "team.agent" form, even
# when two roles share the same thread. The direct session-start.sh path
# instead bundles every "safe" pair (every registered pair whose OWN record
# already names this project+thread) into ONE bridge process, so its key
# can be the multi-pair hash form -- agmsg_codex_bridge_key(project,

#   1. CODEX_THREAD_ID is set (this really is a codex session, and we know

#      this pane (agmsg_self_proof, the same proof `fix` always uses --
#      proof is about OS process ancestry, which /clear never changes, so a
#      seat whose actas lock is stale by SID still proves here).
#   3. That seat's role-session record's project matches this one, and its

# (codex-bridge-launcher.sh, the path codex-monitor.sh actually arms) already
# polls the role-session record and its own request file and retires+
# respawns a bridge bound to the wrong thread on its own -- confirmed by
