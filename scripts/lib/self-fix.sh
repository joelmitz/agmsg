# self-fix.sh -- `fix`: a seat establishes where it is, and repairs itself there.
#
# NO ARGUMENTS. This is the whole design (#1152, ruling of 2026-09-13). A location
# handed in from outside is the accident this exists to remove: measured live,
# a seat whose label had been broken resolved itself through an inherited
# environment into ANOTHER seat's pane and wrote that pane into its own mark --
# it stopped short of typing there only because that pane's name was not
# readable. So nothing tells the seat where it is. The seat proves it:
#
#   1. identity  -- which seats this session holds, from the actas locks it OWNS
#                   (identity is not location; a lock names a role, not a pane)
#   2. candidate -- the pane the environment names, as a CANDIDATE only; the
#                   environment is a generator, never an authority
#   3. proof     -- agmsg_self_proof (#1154): the pane's process is in the
#                   owner's complete ancestry, or it is not, or we cannot tell
#   4. fallback  -- when the proof does not say proved and #1188's emit-and-
#                   observe is present (agmsg_token_locate_pending / _emit /
#                   _observe, #1386), that runs, in the same four-state
#                   contract -- across two SEPARATE calls to this whole
#                   script, since a token this call both emits and searches
#                   for in the same breath is never actually on screen yet
#                   to find (see token-locate.sh)
#   5. write     -- ONLY on proved: the record and decorations through
#                   agmsg_self_write, under the seat-local lock. Anything else
#                   is reported by name and NOTHING is written.
#
# Whoever runs it -- a poke from another seat, a person at the keyboard, a skill
# on a loop -- gets the same answer, because none of them carries a location.
#
# OUTPUT. One line per seat this session holds, then the writer's lines:
#   fix seat=<team>/<agent> state=proved locator=<kind:instance:pane> via=<proof|emit_observe>
#   fix seat=<team>/<agent> state=<disproved|undetermined|unsupported> reason=<r> via=<...> (written nothing)
#   fix none:<no_seat_for_this_session|arguments_refused|...>
# Exit: 0 when every held seat was written; 2 when at least one was not; 1 on refusal.

  # witness (review, #1397): the role this token was emitted for can be
  # restarted, resumed, or handed off to a different session inside the TTL
  # window, and a bare (team, agent) key alone cannot tell that seat's own
  # fresh `fix` call apart from one left over from before the change --
  # observing a stale record then would hand this seat a location the OLD
  # occupant's pane produced, not its own, exactly the outside-supplied
  # location #1152 exists to refuse. Every actas re-claim (restart, resume,
  # handoff) mints a new owner token, so requiring it to match is what makes
  # a stale record from a superseded claim unusable rather than merely
  # unlikely to collide.
