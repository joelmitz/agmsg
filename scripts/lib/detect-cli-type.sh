# Which CLI is this? Detection lives here, not in whoami.sh, because whoami.sh
# is not the only caller that needs the answer (#783/#801): windows/dispatch.sh
# hands the type to join.sh, reset.sh, delivery.sh and identities.sh, and a
# default guessed there registers a real agent under a type nobody chose.
#
# Sourcing this requires lib/type-registry.sh first (agmsg_known_types /
# agmsg_type_get). agmsg_detect_cli_type also needs lib/compat.sh
# (compat_get_comm / compat_get_ppid). This file deliberately does not source
# either, so a caller cannot end up with two copies of the registry's state.

# Auto-detect CLI type from environment variables and the process tree, driven by
# the per-type manifests' `detect=` (env-var names), `detect_fallback=` (weak
# env-var names), and `detect_proc=` (process name globs) keys — no hardcoded
# type list lives here.

# Print known types in detection priority order. Lower numeric priority wins;
# missing or malformed values use the neutral default. The type name breaks
# ties so existing deterministic ordering remains intact for equal priorities.
