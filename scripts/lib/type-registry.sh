# Agent-type registry.
#
# Agent types are discovered from `scripts/drivers/types/<name>/type.conf` manifests instead of
# hardcoded whitelists, so a type (and its template / delivery / session-start /
# spawn behavior) can be added by dropping a directory — including by an external
# add-on outside the agmsg tree.
#
# IMPORTANT — manifests are read-only `key=value` DATA and are NEVER `source`d.
# A small per-key reader is used, so a third-party add-on's manifest cannot
# execute code. Multi-value keys are space-separated.
#
# Discovery + trust are delegated to driver-registry.sh (this is the "types"
# axis). Search bases are <root>/scripts/drivers (built-in), <root>/plugins, and
# $AGMSG_PLUGIN_DIRS. External drivers must be opted into (`agmsg plugin trust`);
# untrusted drop-ins are ignored. Later bases override earlier ones among
# eligible candidates, so an opted-in plugin can shadow a built-in.
#
# Safe under `set -u`: every env read is guarded.

# Resolve THIS lib's directory at SOURCE time. BASH_SOURCE inside a later
# function call — especially within a command-substitution subshell, or when the
# lib was sourced via a relative path from a different cwd — can resolve against
# the wrong directory; capturing it once here is robust however the registry is
# queried later.

# a cache back to cold) -- neither applies here, because re-sourcing this

# below, and never touches $_AGMSG_RENDERABLE_TYPES_LOADED. Only CALLING this
