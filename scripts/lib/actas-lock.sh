# actas-lock.sh — per-(team, agent) exclusivity locks.
#
# Background: agmsg supports a project being registered with multiple agent
# identities of the same type (claude-code/codex/...). Without ownership
# tracking, every concurrent CC session in that project would subscribe to
# every registered identity's messages — duplicate delivery, confused mark-
# read semantics, and the `actas` "exclusive role" model breaking down.
#
# This file implements a small filesystem-based ownership protocol:
#
#   Lock file: $SKILL_DIR/run/actas.<team>__<agent>.session
#   Content  : one line — the owner session_id.
#
# A session_id is alive iff some $SKILL_DIR/run/cc-instance.<pid> file
# currently contains it AND that PID is alive. The same primitive used by
# session-start.sh's orphan-watcher cleanup. Stale locks (owner is no
# longer alive) are reclaimable.
#
# Atomic claim is implemented via `ln` of a per-call tmp file. POSIX
# guarantees the link target either appears or doesn't, even under
# concurrent claim attempts.
#
# Required caller-set variable:
#   SKILL_DIR — agmsg skill root.

: "${SKILL_DIR:?actas-lock.sh requires SKILL_DIR}"

# Owner tokens are per-process instance ids (see instance-id.sh), not bare
# session_ids — this is what keeps parallel --continue/--resume sessions that
# share a session_id from each appearing to own the other's locks (#93). The
# liveness check (actas_lock_sid_alive) delegates to agmsg_instance_alive.

# Reading a lock.
#
# There is exactly ONE reader, and it reports the read's own outcome alongside
# the owner. The function it replaces, `actas_lock_owner`, answered the empty
# string for three different worlds:
#
#     the lock file is not there            -> ""   rc 0
#     the lock file is there but unreadable -> ""   rc 0
#     the lock file is there and is empty   -> ""   rc 0
#
# and returned 0 for all three, so a caller could not separate them even by
# checking the status. Four producers then guessed, and each guessed the
# destructive way: "could not read" arrived as "nobody holds this", which became
# claim / rm / consume. Guarding at each call site is not the fix, because the
# next call site starts from the same empty string. The fold is removed HERE,
# and no owner-only form is left in the tree to fall back into.
# (#983, review ruling; the same shape as terminal_team_observe in #1066.)
#
# Prints "<read>\t<owner>":
#
#   ok\t<owner>    the file was read. <owner> is its first line, and an EMPTY
#                  owner here is a fact ABOUT THE FILE, not a failed read.
#   absent\t       there is no lock file, and the directory it would live in is
#                  searchable -- so "there is none" is something we established.
#   unreadable\t   the lock is there and could not be read, OR its directory
#                  cannot be searched, in which case absence is not knowable.
#                  `[ -e ]` is false for BOTH "no such file" and "cannot look
#                  inside the parent", so the directory is asked first (review).
