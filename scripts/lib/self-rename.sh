# self-rename.sh — a seat fixes its own CLI SESSION NAME by typing the type's
# rename command into its own pane, once, early (#1081).
#
# The third identity cell is the CLI session name. No launch flag sets it after
# start (claude-code's -n is a launch-only flag; codex has none), and a
# hand-started or resumed seat never got one -- yet a person can always fix it by
# typing `/rename <name>`. This hook does that from the inside: a seat knows its
# team, its name, and (from the environment) the pane it is in, so it pokes the
# rename into its own pane.
#
# It is deliberately NOT modelled on self-name.sh's every-action naming, because
# typing into a live session is INVASIVE and its verification WINDOW is narrow:
#   - Invasive: `poke` seizes the keyboard. Doing that to oneself on a loop is how
#     a conversation gets wrecked. So this fires AT MOST ONCE per (seat, pane,
#     server generation); the persisted mark is what stops a second attempt, on
#     the next action AND in the next process.
#   - Narrow window: a name that can only be READ early (codex prints "Thread
#     name:" at the top of the TUI and it scrolls away) can only be VERIFIED
#     early. The window to verify and the window to rename are the same one, which
#     is also why it must run early -- before the /resume picker, before a person
#     grows used to a name. Two reasons, one design.
#
# Two-phase, because the keystroke is QUEUED and lands after the current turn:
#   action 1  observe my name. Correct already -> record ok, type nothing.
#             Unreadable (window gone) -> record why, type nothing (never rename
#             what cannot be verified). Wrong and readable -> poke once, mark
#             "attempted".
#   action 2  the mark says "attempted": the rename has had a turn to land, so
#             re-observe. Took -> ok. Could not read it (scrolled off, load) ->
#             the THIRD word poked_unverified -- typed, could not confirm, NEVER
#             "failed" on a screen we could not read. A title name still wrong ->
#             failed. Either way, no second poke.
#
# Readable and wrong is also where the keystroke is gated on agmsg_self_proof
# (#1206), the same proof `fix` requires before it writes: the placement-claim
# guard below only catches a pane already recorded as someone else's, and a
# pane nobody has claimed yet is not thereby proved to be this seat's. Only a
# `proved` verdict authorizes typing -- and the verdict alone is not enough:
# the proof's own returned locator (the driver's re-observation, never an
# echo of the candidate) must match, EXACTLY, the ref about to be poked. Proof
# without that match, or any other state, is recorded as skipped and nothing
# is poked.
#
# Two-tier opt-out, and it is VISIBLE on the mark, never silent: AGMSG_SELF_NAME=
# off stops the whole self-naming family; AGMSG_SELF_RENAME=off stops only the
# keystroke (more invasive than writing a label -- a person may accept the label
# and refuse the auto-typing).
#
# Never fails the caller: renaming is a side effect of the action. Every path
# returns 0.
