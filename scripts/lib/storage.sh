# validate.sh guards against double-sourcing, so a caller that sources it too is
# unaffected. If neither locator resolves, the validator is simply absent and

  # -- this CRLF ending does not reproduce here). HYPOTHESIS (unverified):
  # the Windows C runtime's stdio text-mode translation rewrites sqlite3's
  # own LF terminators to CRLF on the way out; what is actually confirmed is
  # only the \r\n on the wire, not this mechanism.
  #
  # `ROWS=$(agmsg_sqlite ...)` strips only the trailing newline of the WHOLE
  # captured output (bash command substitution), so every row but the last
  # keeps a \r stuck to its final field -- typically an id, since every
  # multi-field row built by this codebase's callers puts id/cursor/at last
  # and body earlier (never in scope for this fix, but worth naming: it is
  # why this hazard has not already shown up as corrupted message bodies).
  # `IFS=$'\x1f' read` does not split on \r, so that \r rides along into
  # the field value. Reported and measured on real Windows hardware: a
  # 100-message backlog lost 99 of 100 mark-as-read updates in one
  # inbox.sh run, because storage_mark_read_batch's ids no longer matched
  # any real msg_id.
  #
  # The fix normalizes ONLY a \r immediately before the line-ending \n --
  # not every \r in the stream. `tr -d '\r'` (used by _sqlite_data /
  # _sqlite_data_stdin in drivers/storage/sqlite.sh, wrapping calls to THIS
  # function) would also be correct for THIS symptom, but it deletes every
  # \r anywhere in the output, including one that is a message body's own
  # content (char(13) is not replaced the way char(10) already is in every
  # row-building SELECT in this codebase) -- so it is not used here. `sed`'s

#
# Only the sync driver adapter sets it (scripts/internal/storage-sync-driver.sh),

# check with the statement's stderr discarded at the call site, so their caller
# could not tell "the input was refused" from "another writer held the store past
# the timeout". The second is the one failure that is a fact about the moment
# rather than about the input -- the same call succeeds once that writer is done
# -- and the adapter reports it as its own exit status so the engine can wait
# and retry instead of giving up (#910). The word is the LAST call's outcome on
# purpose: a check-failing function returns right after the statement that
# failed, so "the operation failed and the last statement was busy" names it.
#
# stderr is captured to classify it and re-emitted unchanged, so a caller that
# reads or silences it sees what it saw before; stdout is the data stream, now
# passed through the same trailing-CR normalization as agmsg_sqlite()'s own
# non-recording path above (Windows' sqlite3.exe row-separator \r\n; see that
# comment for the full writeup -- this path bypasses it entirely via the early
# `return` above, so it needs its own copy of the fix, not a call into it: this
# function's stdout/stderr routing exists for a different purpose, classifying
# ok/busy/failed for the sync driver adapter, and folding the two together
# would tangle two independent concerns). The exit status is still passed
# through, unaffected either way.
#
# The original fd-3 passthrough trick (sqlite3's own fd 1 repointed at
# whatever fd 1 was outside this function, with no process in between) cannot
# survive inserting `sed`: stdout now goes through an actual pipe, so a temp
# file replaces the `err=$(...)` capture for stderr, and the exit status comes
# from `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` (sqlite3's, not sed's) rather than the substitution's
# own `$?`. Stderr is still read back whole and re-emitted verbatim afterward,
# so a caller that reads or silences it sees the same bytes as before.
#
# The pipeline is wrapped in an `if`, same as the original, and for the same
# reason: this is a plain function call, not a subshell, so it runs in the
# CALLING script's own shell -- and several callers set both `-e` and
# `-o pipefail`. A command tested by `if` is exempt from `set -e` on a
# non-zero exit (POSIX), so the pipeline cannot abort the caller here
# regardless of its pipefail setting.
#
# `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` (sqlite3's exit status, not sed's) is read in BOTH
# branches, not once after the `if` -- and specifically not guarded with
# `|| true` the way the CRLF fix above is, because `|| true` is not safe
# here. `PIPESTATUS` is overwritten by the NEXT command this shell
# executes, of any kind, including a trivial one: `pipeline || true` runs
# `true` whenever the pipeline's own exit status is non-zero, and reading
# `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` after that reads back `true`'s status (0), not
# sqlite3's. The CRLF fix's own `|| true` above is fine BECAUSE that call
# site never reads PIPESTATUS at all. This one silently turned every
# failure here into rc=0 whenever pipefail was already active in the
# caller -- and only there: storage-sync-driver.sh sets `-o pipefail`
# itself, so a plain `bash -c` probe without it stayed green while the
# real busy-timeout contract test (test_remote_sync.bats, "a store
# another writer holds is busy") got 0 where it expected 11. Reading
# PIPESTATUS inside the `if`'s own branches, before anything else runs,
