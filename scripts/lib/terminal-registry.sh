# Terminal registry — the "terminals" driver axis facade.
#
# A terminal driver abstracts the ONE terminal multiplexer a member's CLI runs
# under: tmux, herdr, or plain (no addressable pane). It absorbs the terminal
# operations that were scattered as inline `$TMUX`/`HERDR_*` branches across
# spawn.sh / despawn.sh / watch.sh, behind one contract, and adds peek/poke.
#
# Layout mirrors the types axis (ADR 0002, docs/spec/driver-interface.md):
#   scripts/drivers/terminals/<name>/terminal.conf   read-only key=value DATA
#   scripts/drivers/terminals/<name>/ops.sh          sourced bash, terminal_* fns
# Discovery + trust come from driver-registry.sh (built-ins always trusted,
# externals opt-in). This facade only knows the terminals-axis layout.
#
# Contract (per docs/spec/driver-interface.md §1). Every driver's ops.sh exposes:
#   terminal_check                      control op: deps -> ok|missing_deps(+DIRECTIVE)
#   terminal_describe [project]         exit 0, key=value only (name/backend/capabilities)
#   terminal_detect <session_id>        RECORD op: print this session's own pane id and
#                                       exit 0 IFF we are running under this terminal now;
#                                       non-zero (no stdout) otherwise. herdr resolves the
#                                       pane from the session id (NOT inherited env);
#                                       tmux uses $TMUX_PANE; plain is the exit-0 fallback
#                                       printing '-' (no addressable pane).
#   terminal_spawn <name> <project> <target> <boot...>   RECORD op: create a pane/window,
#                                       launch boot, print the new bare pane id.
#   terminal_despawn <id>               control op: kill the pane/window named by bare <id>.
#   terminal_peek <id> [--lines N]      RECORD op: print visible pane text verbatim (NOT
#                                       parsed). unsupported -> exit 13, reason on stderr.
#   terminal_poke <id> <text>           control op: send text and submit. unsupported -> 13.
#   terminal_pane_state <id>            READ ONLY: is that pane still there?
#                                       Prints gone / present / unknown and
#                                       returns 0 for a settled answer, 13 when
#                                       this terminal has no addressable pane to
#                                       ask about, 10 when it could not be
#                                       reached. "Could not ask" never returns 0:
#                                       a caller deletes the placement record on
#                                       `gone` alone, and `terminal_despawn`
#                                       cannot answer this (it collapses "already
#                                       closed" and "could not close" into 13).
#   terminal_where <id>                 READ op: print the id's container (tmux window /
#                                       herdr tab). Existence is not answered here;
#                                       a missing id is unknown/10, never `gone`.
#   terminal_arrange <source-id> <intent> <target-id>
#                                       control op: declaratively place source below/right
#                                       of target. Prints moved / unchanged. It reads layout
#                                       before mutating because the native moves are not
#                                       idempotent. Ambiguous layout -> token + non-zero.
#   terminal_name <id> <team> <name> [mode]
#                                       control op: set the pane's names; idempotent.
#                                       Two names, not one: the label a person
#                                       reads and the key the TERMINAL addresses
#                                       the agent by in its own namespace. This
#                                       repo's peek/poke resolve through the
#                                       placement record, not the key.
#                                       `mode=key` sets only the key
#                                       (AGMSG_TERMINAL_NAMING=off); absent sets
#                                       both. A driver that has only one name
#                                       treats it as the key.
#                                       (safe to re-apply on SessionStart).
#
# Detection is a driver FUNCTION (not a manifest datum like the types axis's
# detect=) because herdr's "which pane am I" is logic, not a set of env vars. The

# --- name THIS pane, and record where it is ---------------------------------
#
# The step that makes peek/poke reach a member nobody spawned: join, actas and
# SessionStart all call it, so a pane a human opened by hand is as addressable as
# a spawned one. Limiting peek/poke to spawned members was refused (fujibee,
# 2026-08-28); this is what lifts the limit. SessionStart is not optional — herdr
# drops an agent's name when the agent exits, so a resume must re-apply it.
#
# Three outcomes, deliberately kept apart:
#
#   named    the terminal can name a pane AND this pane was identified, so the
#            driver names it. A "<terminal>:<id>" placement record -- the same one
#            spawn writes -- follows ONLY when the caller asked for one; see the
#            6th argument.
#   skipped  the terminal has no `name` capability (plain has no addressable
#            pane). QUIET, 0, and NO record: a permanent property of the terminal
#            is not news on every join, and a record whose id cannot be acted on
#            is not a placement -- writing one is a bug in the writer (ruling,
#            2026-08-31).
#   unnamed  the terminal CAN name, A SESSION ID WAS GIVEN, and this pane still
#            could not be identified. non-zero, reason already on stderr from the
#            resolver: saying "cannot name this pane" beats naming nothing.
#
# The session id qualifies `unnamed` on purpose. Called WITHOUT one -- join has
# none to give, there being no per-type datum saying which env var carries it --
# a terminal that needs it is `skipped`, not `unnamed`. No input is a different
# fact from a failed lookup, and reporting the first as the second would warn on
# every join under herdr about a condition nobody can act on.
#
# Callers treat non-zero as a WARNING, never as a failure of the join/claim/
# session-start they are performing. Naming is additive; it must not change what
# those commands do or return.
#
# The 6th argument decides whether a PLACEMENT RECORD is written, and it defaults
# to NOT writing one. Naming a pane and being the authoritative placement for a
# seat are different claims: `join` names a pane but proves nothing about who
# holds the seat -- the same identity can be joined from a second session while a
# first one holds it through actas -- so a record written there would redirect
# peek/poke/despawn at a pane that does not have the seat. Only a caller with
# positive evidence of ownership passes `record`: actas (it went through the
# claim) and SessionStart (the seat is resolved). The default is the safe half, so
# a caller added later that has not thought about it cannot silently take a
# placement over.
