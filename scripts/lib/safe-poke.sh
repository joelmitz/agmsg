# abandoned draft.

# Before this existed, poke.sh carried its own copy of the #1321/#1322
# input-box check (typing into ANOTHER member's pane), while self-rename.sh
# and self-write.sh called terminal_poke directly, unchecked (typing into
# THIS session's OWN pane -- a human co-piloting the same seat, or a draft
# left in it, carries exactly the same corruption risk poke.sh already
# guarded against). Consolidated into one routine, routing all four call
# sites through it, without changing self-rename.sh's/self-write.sh's own
# calling shape (return-value handling, no output) -- both already redirect
# `>/dev/null 2>&1`, so nothing this file prints reaches them.
#
# Requires: SKILL_DIR set (the #1384 draft file's directory), and the
# target's terminal driver already loaded via agmsg_terminal_load -- this
# never loads one itself, the same division every other terminal_*
# consumer in this codebase keeps.
