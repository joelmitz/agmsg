#!/usr/bin/env bash
# self-write.sh -- the ONE path by which a seat writes its own identity cells.
#
# #1152 inverted who writes a seat's identity. Before, three writers (spawn,
# `team --fix`, the seat's own hook) each wrote whichever seat they resolved,
# and every fix was an arbitration between them. Now one writer, the seat
# itself, writes ONLY its own cells, and nothing here reads another seat's state
# to decide a write. There is no "who is right" left to decide.
#
# WHERE THE PANE COMES FROM. Not from here, and not from outside. The seat
# PROVES it (scripts/lib/self-fix.sh, ruling of 2026-09-13): its own process
# ancestry against the pane's processes (self-proof.sh), or failing that a token
# it writes to its own screen and finds (token-locate.sh); if neither decides,
# nothing is written. A location handed in from outside was measured to be the
# accident itself: a seat with a broken label resolved itself through an
# inherited environment into ANOTHER seat's pane. So <ref> arrives here already
# proved, and it is a LOCATION, never an identity: team and agent come from the
# seat's own actas, and no argument may name another seat.
#
# THE FENCE. Pane ids repeat across terminal instances (two herdr sessions both
# have a w1:p2; tmux has one id space per socket), so a pane id alone can name
# a live pane in another instance. Each write generation therefore takes a
# fence -- the driver's <instance, terminal_id> for the pane -- once, stores it
# in the placement record, and re-reads it right before EVERY later mutation in
# the generation; a difference in either half refuses the mutation, visibly.
# This is best-effort safety: a preflight check that minimises the window, not
# an atomic fence. The read and the keystroke are separate calls, so a pane
# closed and reused between them is not caught; a full fence needs the terminal
# to compare-and-type. A herdr restart changes every terminal_id, so a stored
# fence expires with the server: the record then refuses instead of writing into
# whatever now sits at that id, and the next sweep re-delivers.
#
# CELLS, in order, each independent: record (REQUIRED -- the only cell a seat's
# reachability runs through) / label / key / session (decorations: their failure
# is visible, and does not stop the record). The session cell types
# `<rename_cmd> <team>-<agent>` UNCONDITIONALLY, at most once per generation,
# when the pane's input is ready: there is no pre-read skip, no stored mark and
# no process flag, because every one of those was a stale value keyed to skip a
# needed rename (#1130's shape). The title before and after is observation only.
#
# EXCLUSION. The whole generation runs under the seat-local single-flight lock
# (self-write-lock.sh). A second writer on the same seat sees `none:busy` --
# never a silent drop, because "did it, not fixed" and "doing it now" look the
# same from outside.
#
# OUTPUT. One line per fact, never silence:
#   seat=<team>/<agent> sid=<owner> pane=<ref>        or
#   seat=... none:<busy:<owner>|bad_ref|no_driver|lock_unknown:<r>|fence_unreadable:<r>>
#   seat=... unsupported:<r>                            (plain: no pane exists)
#   fence[(-v2)]=<encoded-instance>:<terminal_id>
#   record  attempt=<ok|failed:<r>>            readback=<verified|mismatch:<seen>|unavailable:<r>|not_attempted>
#   label   attempt=<ok|failed:<rc>|skipped:<r>> readback=<...>
#   key     attempt=<same as label: one terminal_name call> readback=<...>
#   session attempt=<ok|failed:<rc>|skipped:<r>> readback=<verified|matched_no_delta|unchanged:<seen>|mismatch:<seen>|unavailable:<r>|failed:<r>|not_attempted>
#   policy=<accepted|accepted_unverified|repair_incomplete>
#
# A type that declares rename_confirm (codex: its session name is not on the
# title, and the one header that carries it scrolls away early) is verified by
# NEWNESS of its own confirmation line -- counted before and after the
# keystroke, an increase required -- never by title/screen-header readback,
# which the type's own manifest documents as unfit for this (#1109/#1152 stage
# C). `readback=failed:rename_not_observed` is that path's one negative that is
# NOT "could not tell": the confirmation line is the command's immediate
# output, so its absence after a successful keystroke is a real miss.
# The same lines are written, last and atomically, to run/self-write-done.<t>__<a>.
# policy is decided HERE and only here: accepted = record verified;
# accepted_unverified = record written, readback unavailable; anything else in
# the record = repair_incomplete. Decorations never change it.
