# hooks-json.sh — JSON/SQLite primitives for editing an agent's settings hooks file.
#
# These are the low-level read-modify-write helpers that delivery.sh uses to add
# and remove agmsg-owned hook entries from a settings.json-shaped file. They are
# pure JSON manipulation built on sqlite3's json1 + readfile()/writefile(), with
# no knowledge of delivery modes or agent-type dispatch (that lives in
# delivery.sh). Split out of delivery.sh so the gnarly sqlite/JSON layer — and
# its accumulated bug-fix guards (#95 E2BIG, #143/#102 control-byte escaping,
# #162 byte-count validation, #134 JSON escaping) — can be read and tested on
# its own.
#
# Sourced by delivery.sh AFTER it defines SKILL_DIR (used to detect
# agmsg-owned entries); the existing lib convention is for sourced modules to
# reference caller-set globals rather than re-resolve them.

# This file used to carry its own copy of the path converter. One definition
# now, in lib/sqlpath.sh — see the note there for why a second copy is worse
# than no copy (#669).

# Reads the settings via sqlite3's readfile() rather than interpolating the

# settings blob 6× into a single sqlite3 argv element; on Linux that hits
# the per-arg MAX_ARG_STRLEN cap (131072 bytes) once the settings file
# crosses ~21 KB, so `delivery.sh set` failed with E2BIG (see #95). Using
# readfile() keeps the file off the argv entirely.

  # using caret notation ("^M"), corrupting the JSON so the next read fails
  # with "malformed JSON" (#143/#138, same root cause as #102). writefile()
  # emits the bytes verbatim. See also strip's readfile() (#95).
  # Validate writefile()'s result, not just sqlite3's exit code. writefile()
  # returns the byte count written and yields NULL on a failed write (e.g. an
  # unwritable tmp dir) — but sqlite3 still exits 0, so an exit-code-only check
  # would mv an empty/partial tmp over the original. Compare the bytes written
  # to the content's byte length (CAST AS BLOB so multibyte content isn't
  # miscounted by character-based length()); anything but an exact match fails.

# Wrap a POSIX shell command so Codex's Windows runner executes it through Git
# Bash. On native Windows, Codex runs each hook command via PowerShell, which
# cannot execute a bare POSIX ".sh" path, so the hook exits non-zero. Codex hook
# config supports a "commandWindows" key that takes precedence on Windows.
#
# The shell stays a LOGIN shell, and the payload no longer travels on its stdout
# (#1015). `-l` reads the profile chain, and everything the profile prints goes
# to that same stdout, ahead of the JSON -- codex parses the whole stream as one
# document, so one line of profile chatter makes the payload unparseable, and by
# then the hook has already consumed the rows. Measured on macOS and Linux as
# well as reported on Windows: the mechanism is bash's, not Windows's.
#
# Dropping `-l` would close it and was the first plan. Measured instead: with a
# profile that exports a PATH the command needs, the non-login shell cannot find
# the tool and the hook exits without emitting anything. That trades a silent
# loss for a total one, and only under a premise nobody has measured -- whether a
# given Git Bash profile provides something the hook relies on. Keeping `-l`
# needs no such premise.
#
# So: bash writes the command's own stdout to a file, PowerShell -- which read no
# profile -- prints the file, and the login shell's stdout is discarded. The
# braces are there so the redirect covers the whole command however it is
# composed, not just its last element. The exit status is carried across
# explicitly; without it the hook would report on `Remove-Item`.
#
# No `\"` anywhere in what is emitted: PowerShell reads a backslash-escaped
# quote as a literal backslash and ends the string there (see the codex
# template's warning).

# SORTED BY fullkey, concatenated into one string.
#
# Sorting by fullkey -- not json_tree's own traversal order -- is what makes
# this key-order independent: fullkey spells out an OBJECT member as
# ...".matcher" / ...".hooks" by NAME, so two objects with the same members
# in a different source order (e.g. one hand-edited through `jq -S`, which
# sorts keys) produce the exact same set of (fullkey, type, atom) rows and
# therefore the same sorted signature. This was review-round-1's actual bug:
# comparing via plain json() instead (a canonical *compact* rendering, but
# NOT canonical on key order -- json('{"a":1,"b":2}') != json('{"b":2,"a":1}')
# in sqlite) called a same-content, key-reordered hooks_file "different" and
# triggered exactly the spurious rewrite (or read-only refusal) this

# fullkey embeds its numeric index (e.g. "$.hooks[0]"), so array order still
# participates in the sort and is not collapsed away.
