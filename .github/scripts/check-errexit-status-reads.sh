# Three ways to be wrong, one shape to look for — a status read that follows
# something errexit already decided:
#
#   [bare]    x=$(cmd)          the assignment's status IS the substitution's,
#             rc=$?             so a non-zero one kills the shell HERE. The
#                               next line is unreachable; the handler it feeds
#                               has never run.
#
#   [decl]    local x=$(cmd)    `local`/`declare`/`typeset`/`export`/`readonly`
#             rc=$?             is a builtin whose own status wins. The shell
#                               survives and `rc` is ALWAYS 0 — a handler that
#                               reads as present and can never fire. This is
#                               the quiet one; nothing crashes.
#
#   [source]  . file            On bash 3.2 a failing command at the top of a
#             rc=$?             sourced file fires the CALLER's errexit, and it
#                               does so EVEN with `|| rc=$?` on the source line
#                               (measured; the `||` does not save 3.2). macOS
#                               /bin/bash is 3.2, so this is a macOS-only death
#                               that passes every Linux run.
#
# The accepted fix for all three is the codebase's two-line lift — see
# `agmsg_terminal_load` in scripts/lib/terminal-registry.sh:
#
#     local rc=0 restore_e=0
#     case $- in *e*) restore_e=1 ;; esac
#     set +e
#     x=$(cmd)          # or `. file`
#     rc=$?
#     [ "$restore_e" = 1 ] && set -e
#
# so a statement sitting between `set +e` and `set -e` is NOT flagged: that is
# the fix, not the defect. `|| rc=$?` is not flagged either for [bare]/[decl]
# (measured correct on both shells) — but it does NOT clear [source].
#
# WHAT IS EXCLUDED, and why:
#   - anything between `set +e` and the next `set -e`: errexit is lifted, which
#     is the whole point of lifting it
#   - a statement carrying `||` or `&&`: explicit control (except [source])
#   - the condition of `if` / `while` / `until`: errexit does not apply there
#
# The baseline is a COUNT, not a file:line list, so moving code between files
# does not produce a spurious failure. It may only go down.
#
# WHY THIS CANNOT PASS BY FAILING TO LOOK: before it reports anything about the
# tree, it runs the same scanner over a fixture holding one known-bad instance
# of each kind and requires all three back. A regex that stops matching — a
# refactor, a quoting change, a wrong path — then exits 2 (could not answer)
# instead of 0 (nothing found). "Zero" is only ever printed by a scanner that
# has just proved it can find one.

    A command substitution opens a FRESH quoting context even when it appears

#   single- and double-quoted strings         all controls

#   a TRAILING comment, incl. one holding

#                                             header comment carries one; if the
#                                             scanner treats it as a quote the
#                                             continuation pin goes red first
#                                             (the swallow starts in that same
#                                             header), and sql_bare with it
#   the two ACCEPTED forms staying silent     lifted_case / guarded_case /

# NOT COVERED — a status read hidden inside any of these is invisible here, and
# nobody has measured whether the tree contains one:
#   backticks `cmd` instead of $( )           the scanner keys on `$(` and on a
#                                             literal backtick in the RHS, but
#                                             no control exercises a backtick
#                                             spanning lines
#   heredocs                                  their body is scanned as ordinary
#                                             text, so a `;` or a quote inside
#                                             one can still split a statement
#   `{ ...; }` and `( ... )` grouping         treated as plain text
#   arithmetic `$(( ))` and `((  ))`          `$((` enters the `$(` stack and
#                                             its `))` pops only one level
#   `case` patterns' `;;`                     splits, which is harmless today
#                                             but is not asserted anywhere
#   `set -e` toggled inside a function or a
#     subshell                                lifting is tracked file-wide, not

#
# And one that is NOT a syntax gap, which is why the list above missed it:
#
#   a BARE COMMAND OR FUNCTION CALL           `f "$x"; rc=$?` is not looked at.
#     followed by `rc=$?`  -> #1034           The predecessor is only examined
#                                             when it is an assignment with a
#                                             command substitution, or a
#                                             `source` — so the most ordinary
#                                             producer of `$?` is skipped
#                                             entirely. Under `set -e` such a
#                                             call exits the shell before the
#                                             status can be classified. Found by
#                                             review, not by this file. The
#                                             splitter is NOT the problem: it
#                                             already returns the two statements
#                                             correctly; the PREDICATE is what
#                                             is narrow. Widening it, and
#                                             counting what the tree then shows,
#                                             is #1034 — deliberately not done

#                                             and would move the baseline.
