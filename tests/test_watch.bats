# These wait for the thing the caller is about to assert instead of sleeping a

# now", which is a claim about the machine rather than about the watcher: on a
# loaded runner it is false, and the test then fails on its own assertion with no
# hint that timing was the cause. `watch: persists a watermark file for the
# session` failed exactly that way on main (macos shard 3/4), and `watch: restart
# delivers messages that arrived while the watcher was down` failed the same way
# the day before. Same class of defect as #503, same fix.
#
# A wait that times out returns non-zero HERE, so the failure names the condition
# that never happened rather than surfacing later as a missing grep.
# The launch is written out in each helper rather than factored into a
# `pid=$(_start_watcher ...)` helper on purpose. A command substitution is a
# subshell, so the watcher's parent would exit the instant the substitution
# returned, and watch.sh — which stops within one interval once its session is
# gone (#67) — would tear itself down before the condition could ever arrive. A
# function call is not a subshell, so launching here keeps the test process as
# the watcher's parent, exactly as the fixed-sleep version did.
