# One test, capping how many external commands a watch.sh poll cycle forks
# while genuinely idle (a store that exists and is already caught up, not the
# "no store yet" short-circuit) -- the case the fleet spends nearly all of its
# time in. Covers #1330's two stages:
#
#   first stage:  skip the mktemp + `sqlite3 :memory:` json_each/json_extract
#                 reformat pass when there is no real new message_sent row (a
#                 cursor-only page was still paying for it every cycle), and
#                 cache the per-(team,agent) primitives behind the actas lock
#                 path (team_id, member_id, the two name-encodings) for the
#                 life of the process instead of recomputing them via a fresh
#                 sqlite3/tr fork on every single cycle.
#
#   second stage: cache a team's storage partition driver too, but only for
#                 the CURRENT poll cycle (never the process lifetime -- see
#                 _agmsg_partition_load's comment in lib/storage.sh: caching
#                 it for the process life missed a real migrate-team-store.sh
#                 scenario, review #1329 round 2), and memoize
#                 agmsg_storage_dir (a value that genuinely cannot change for
#                 the life of the process). Both warmed as plain statements in
#                 this loop, and storage.sh gained a double-source guard after
#                 resolve-project.sh's own unconditional re-source of it was
#                 found silently wiping both caches back to cold every cycle.
