#
# What the poke tests pin is the argv SHAPE, per the #619 lesson: the text and
# the Enter must arrive in SEPARATE tmux invocations, with the arrow key in the
# Enter's burst — a fake binary cannot verify that the real Codex reads the
# result as a submission (the live matrix does), but it CAN prove the calls did
# not collapse back into one burst, which is exactly the regression #619 was.
# The gap between the bursts is a sleep the argv log cannot see; only the live
# matrix observes timing.
#
# Assertions use grep/[ ]/case throughout — no non-last [[ ]] or `! cmd`,
# which the enforced-assertions baseline counts (#670).
