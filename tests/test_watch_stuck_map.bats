# Unit tests for the watcher's stuck-cursor tracker (lib/watch-stuck-map.sh,
# #1045 fix 2). These exercise the two failure modes a full-watcher test cannot
# pin down deterministically on a shared host, where a poll-cycle count drifts
# with load (see [[this machine cannot measure time]]):
#
#   1. A team or agent NAME WITH A SPACE must still be tracked. The first cut
#      framed records with a space and scanned them with `for e in $MAP`, so a
#      spaced name split across two words and its record never matched -- the
#      guard then never fired for that pair. Restoring word splitting turns the
#      "spaced name round-trips" tests below RED.
#   2. The count must RESET when the watcher stops observing a pair (held by
#      another session, or no store yet). Those branches call _stuck_drop; if
#      they did not, a resumed pair would inherit its old count and a healthy
#      watcher would exit early. "a drop makes a resumed pair start fresh" is
#      that reset, isolated from timing.
