"""Minimal mock of OpenRouter's /api/alpha/decisions endpoint, for the
ext-tool jev adapter's own test. Not part of the shipped product -- test-only,
and the real OpenRouter API is never called in CI (design note §5b).

It records the most recently received request (path, Authorization header,
and parsed JSON body) so the test can assert handle sent the right thing,
and answers with a configurable decision response or error, without ever
touching the real API.
