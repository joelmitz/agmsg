# arrives between those two points can still be taken by the departing watcher.
# The implementation does not make that atomic and does not claim to. An earlier
# version of this test sent the message immediately after the claim and slept
# four poll intervals, which asserted the atomic version by accident: it passed
# or failed on whichever interleaving occurred, so a red did not identify a
# defect and a green did not establish the property. If the atomic guarantee is
# ever wanted, it needs the lock re-read moved next to the mark-read, and a test
