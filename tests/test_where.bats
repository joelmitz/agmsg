# where.sh (#1171) — a driver-neutral way for a session to ask its own
# placement, so a caller never has to guess or type a terminal-specific
# command (the #1171 incident: an agent under herdr ran a raw `tmux
# display-message`, and converted the resulting OS error into a false claim
# about its own placement). The load-bearing property this file protects:
# "could not determine" and "there is no pane" must come back as visibly
# different answers — never the same bare negative.
